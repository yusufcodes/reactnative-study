## React Native CLI

### Running a React Native Application - Android
1. Start Metro

**Metro**: "takes in an entry file and various options, and returns a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its dependencies."

(Can use Yarn as well)
```
npx react-native start
```
Keep Metro running in a separate terminal.

2. Start the application
```
npx react-native run-android
```

3. Modifying the app
- Edit anything in App.js
- Reload: Press R twice, or select Reload from Developer Menu (Command M)

### Getting started with React Native - Notes
